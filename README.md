## Visual Communication

Graphic designers convey messages and information to an audience through visual elements, speaking through design instead of words. They must translate complex ideas into compelling stories that evoke emotions and reactions in viewers.

For instance, brand designers identify, establish, and maintain a brandâ€™s visual style, which conveys an intended mood, tone, and message to a customer. Although a brandâ€™s logo may not contain words, it tells customers a story about the brand.

Developing effective visual communication skills is critical for graphic designers. Explore everything you can through reading, experimenting with design, and engaging in learning opportunities like this course. The more experience you gain, the better youâ€™ll be able to communicate visually.

## Communication Strategies

To communicate effectively as a graphic designer, youâ€™ll need to thoroughly understand your clientsâ€™ needs and objectives. While you can use multiple types of strategies, here are a few that will help you establish good project communication:

1. **Project Brief:** A document that outlines all information about the project, including the clientâ€™s goals, strategies, brand identity, target audience, timeline, budget, and other requirements. Completing a project brief will help you understand the clientâ€™s directions and expectations as well as answer any questions about the project objectives.

2. **Discovery Process:** A graphic design project may involve solving a problem, such as using web or interface design to attract new customers. Youâ€™ll need to conduct a discovery process and create a knowledge base that ultimately directs your design decisions. Brainstorm ideas and then share them with peers to see how theyâ€™re received, and continue to explore the ideas that resonate best. Then, create prototypes and concepts based on your research using apps such as Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop.

3. **Moodboards:** Moodboards are a type of visual aid that helps direct teams and stakeholders and build consensus before the design process begins. These boards define ideas for primary colors, styles, images, aesthetics, and other foundational elements that can tell your intended story. They serve as inspiration and a reference for the overall style and feel of a project.

## Design Techniques

Visual communication involves multiple elements. While you can use various techniques to create a visual message, become familiar with the following basics:

### Color

Color evokes emotions, attracts attention, and creates a visual hierarchy. Itâ€™s a powerful tool for communicating and creating a mood in your designs.

### Form

Form is a technique for creating the illusion of three-dimensional depth on a flat surface. It adds visual interest and realism to a design and helps engage the viewer.

### Lines

Lines create boundaries, emphasize elements, define shapes, indicate movement, and guide the viewer. They act as building blocks for visuals. Play with emphasis by adjusting thickness, color, and patterns.

### Shapes

Shapes create a visual foundation and help guide the viewerâ€™s eye. Depending on placement, they can also evoke feelings or represent concepts.

### Space

Space â€” commonly referred to as *negative space* â€” is the empty area around design elements. Use space to create emphasis and strategically balance composition, enhance design clarity, and create perspective.

### Texture

Texture creates the illusion of a particular surface or material. It can help establish the tone and style of a design, which may attract or repel an audience. Add texture through photos â€” such as images of leaves, water, or clouds â€” or through artificial characteristics like patterns or paint.

### Layout

Layout is the arrangement of visual elements like text, shapes, images, and lines. An effective layout arranges elements intuitively and helps the viewer navigate a designâ€™s structure.

### Typography

Typography styles text to make it readable to the viewer. However, it also conveys messages through fonts, weights, spacing, and other elements. Typography also establishes a visual hierarchy and directs the viewer through the design.

### Imagery

Imagery is a powerful tool in storytelling. It can create a connection with an audience, evoke emotion, and express ideas or feelings that may be difficult to convey through words. Think of your favorite image and reflect on how it makes you feel. Thatâ€™s the power of imagery.

## Complementary Skills

To be an effective graphic designer, youâ€™ll also want to focus on non-technical, complementary communication skills that require your attention and care.

Effective communication always involves working with others. Think about how you interact with people, and consider your strengths and weaknesses. You may possess the best technical skills in the world, but you wonâ€™t have a job unless people enjoy working with you. Some skills to consider include listening, empathy, patience, resilience, curiosity, attention to detail, problem-solving, time management, and collaboration.

Be introspective and take the time to reflect on these skills. For real feedback, ask a trusted friend or colleague how youâ€™re doing and set goals for improvement.
